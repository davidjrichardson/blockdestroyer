# WarwickMaze "Grand Finale" Game
## About

A game built around the University of Warwick "WarwickMaze" java courseware applet. This software constructs a game around the applet using the coursework resources and the native Java UI framework. A screenshot of the game is:

The solution uses Java reflection to access private variables in various classes as well as re-implements key UI elements to allow for multiple colours on the maze grid.

**This is not a solution to the CS118 Programming for Computer Scientists programming assignment(s)**, its only purpose is to serve as an example (and possible inspiration) for other "fun" solutions for the CS118 programming competition. The seminar tutors and module organiser(s) will be aware of this repository. Remember that **plagiarism is a serious offence.**

This file is compiled just like any of the latter challenges in the programming assignments.
